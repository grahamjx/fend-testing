  "body": "### Getting Started\r\n\r\nThis project uses gulp to build the web application and host it locally on port 8000.\r\n\r\n1. [Install Node.js] (https://nodejs.org/en/download/)\r\n2. Clone the repository\r\n\r\n    `$ git clone https://github.com/slkcoin/FEND-map`\r\n\r\n3. Navigate to the project folder and run npm install\r\n\r\n  ```bash\r\n  $> cd /path/to/your-project-folder\r\n  $> npm install\r\n  ```\r\n4. This will install everything necessary to evaluate the project. If you're curious about what gets installed, check out the package.json file.\r\n\r\n5. Run gulp from project directory\r\n   \r\n    `$ gulp serve`\r\n  \r\n6. Open a browser and visit localhost:8000\r\n\r\n### The Project\r\n\r\nFor this final project, I had to write Jasmine specs in order to effectively test the provided application.\r\n\r\n1. A test that loops through each feed in the allFeeds object and ensures it has a URL defined and that the URL is not empty.\r\n\r\n2. A test that loops through each feed in the allFeeds object and ensures it has a name defined and that the name is not empty.\r\n\r\n3. A test that ensures the menu element is hidden by default.\r\n\r\n4. A test that ensures the menu changes visibility when the menu icon is clicked.\r\n\r\n5. A test that ensures when the loadFeed function is called and completes its work, there is at least a single .entry element within the .feed container.\r\n\r\n6. A test that ensures when a new feed is loaded by the loadFeed function that the content actually changes.\r\n",
